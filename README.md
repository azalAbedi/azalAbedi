- 👋 Hi, I’m Azal from Canada 🇨🇦
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Web Development!
- 🌱 I’m currently honing my React & Python skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts of web apps, and overall projects related to art, media, design, business, education, and technology!
- 📫 How to reach me is easy! Shoot me a message here on GitHub or connect on Twitter / LinkedIn (link on my GH profile). 
- 😅 Like a good web app, I'm very responsive (sry!).
